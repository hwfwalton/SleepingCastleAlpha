 ## Mystery of the Sleeping Castle

The Mystery of the Sleeping Castle is a narrative detective game in the style of Case of the Golden Idol and Return of the Obra Dinn, but pinker, more fairytale, and EVERYBODY LIVES! (well, mostly) Make your way through the castle, observe clues and make deductions to solve puzzles, identify the residents, and ultimately release the castle from slumber.
